Thoughts come and go. Feelings come and go. Find out what it is that remains.
Happiness is your nature. It is not wrong to desire it. What is wrong is seeking it outside when it is inside.
Peace is your natural state. It is the mind that obstructs the natural state.
As you are, so is the world.
He who thinks he is the doer is also the sufferer.
Self-inquiry is the process and the goal also. ‘I am’ is the goal and the final reality.
The world is not outside you.
That which is not present in deep dreamless sleep is not real.
Doubts arise because of an absence of surrender.
The place where even the slightest trace of the ‘I’ does not exist, alone is Self.
There are no others.
You can only stop the flow of thoughts by refusing to have any interest in it.
There is neither Past nor Future. There is only the Present.
No one succeeds without effort... Those who succeed owe their success to perseverance.
Everything in the world was my Guru.
Do what is right at a given moment and leave it behind.
You are awareness. Awareness is another name for you. Since you are awareness there is no need to attain or cultivate it.
It will come all right in the end.
You are already that which you seek.
Let come what comes, let go what goes- see what remains.
Peace is your natural state. It is your mind that destroys it.
Silence is also conversation.
When the I is divested of the I, only the I remains.
